Got it 👍
I’m aligned with this approach and I’ll follow it **consistently for all your next questions**.

### How I’ll answer going forward

For **each question you ask (one by one)**, I will:

1. **Explain briefly but completely**

   * Core concept
   * Why it exists / why it’s used
   * Where it’s used in real projects
   * Important edge cases / pitfalls

2. **Add interview-focused points**

   * Keywords interviewers expect
   * Follow-up angles they usually ask

3. **Provide a proper, full, usable code example**

   * Production-style code (not toy snippets)
   * Correct annotations, configs, imports
   * Runnable / realistic example (Java/Spring/etc.)

4. **Keep it concise**

   * No unnecessary fluff
   * Dense, high-value explanations

This matches exactly how **senior backend / Java / cloud / security interviews** are evaluated.

👉 You can start now.
Ask your **first question**.
