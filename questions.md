Got it 👍
This role is **senior, cloud-native, Java-centric, security-heavy, and integration-focused**. Below is a **carefully designed, deep interview question bank**, structured the way **Help AG / cybersecurity-first organizations** actually interview.

I’ve grouped questions by **theme + difficulty**, including **scenario, design, and “pressure” questions**. This is intentionally exhaustive so you don’t get surprised.
